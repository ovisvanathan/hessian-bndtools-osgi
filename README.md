hessian-bndtools
================

This repository contains several bndtools projects that explain how to consume OSGi declarative services from an external java application

The bndtools run descriptor is not in working state. It is better to copy the jars in the generated directory and deploy them to a OSGi container and run the code.

The code is based on the hessian project available at http://hessian.caucho.com/.

The basis for this code is the jroller article available at http://www.jroller.com/ouertani/entry/hessian_extender_on_osgi_container
